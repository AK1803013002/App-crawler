App Crawler is targeted at developers who want to ensure their appâ€™s basic functionality with minimal configuration. In addition to purely black-box testing, the crawler can also be configured to provide specific inputs, such as login credentials or deep links.

Getting started

Before starting, make sure you have a recent version of the Android SDK. This comes with Android Studio. If you install a standalone Android SDK, make sure it includes the latest latest build tools and platform tools.
Then, download the crawler binary archive.
Next, either start an emulator or connect a physical device using a USB cable. Confirm the device is connected by running the following command:

adb devices

To invoke the crawler, first extract the archive to the directory of your choice. From that directory, invoke the crawler using the following command:

java -jar crawl_launcher.jar --apk-file path/to/my/app.apk --android-sdk path/to/my/android/sdk

Known issues
